suggestions for improvement:
- The state management could be improved.  Instead of creating a separate useState hook for each language, manage the entire `languages` array in a single useState hook. This will simplify state updates and make the code more maintainable.
- The UI could be improved for better presentation. Using a table inside a button is unusual and not semantically correct.  Consider using more standard HTML elements to structure the content (e.g., divs, spans).
- Add error handling (though unlikely needed in this simple example).
- Improve styling.  In-line styles are generally discouraged for anything beyond very simple adjustments. Use CSS classes for better organization and maintainability.
