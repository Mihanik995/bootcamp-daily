suggestions for improvement:
- The code doesn't prevent the same quote from appearing twice in a row.  Implement a mechanism to ensure that the next quote is different from the current one.
- The code lacks functionality for changing the background, header, and button colors randomly. Add this feature.
- Add error handling for the case where `quotes.json` is empty or improperly formatted.
- Consider using a more robust method for generating random colors.  The current implementation (which is not present) might produce undesirable colors or accessibility issues.
