suggestions for improvement:
- Add filtering functionality based on completion status as described in the instructions.  This component only handles editing and removal, not filtering.
- Consider using a more descriptive name for the component, like `TaskItem` or `EditableTaskItem`.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code lacks task editing functionality.  An 'Edit' button and mechanism for updating task text using useRef are missing.
- While filtering works, the implementation could be improved for readability and maintainability. Consider using a more concise filtering logic (e.g., array filter with a ternary operator).
- Add error handling and input validation (e.g., prevent adding empty tasks).
