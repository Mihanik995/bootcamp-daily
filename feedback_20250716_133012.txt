suggestions for improvement:
- Add input validation to handle non-numeric input.  Currently, entering non-numeric values will lead to NaN in the sum.
- Implement the bonus feature: a select element to allow users to choose different operations (subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Improve readability by adding more descriptive variable names (e.g., num1, num2, result instead of first, second, sum).
- Consider using a more user-friendly way to handle the undefined sum initially (e.g., display '0' or 'Result:').
